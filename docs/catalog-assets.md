# Catalog assets

Reusable catalog sources live in `catalog/kits/<kit>/`. Each `.kcad.ts` file
declares its metadata and parameter knobs; `catalog/index.json` is generated
from those sources and must be rebuilt in the same change.

## Build and audit

```sh
npx tsx scripts/buildAssetCatalog.ts
npx eslint catalog/
npx vitest run tests/integration/catalog/
```

The index builder evaluates and exports each source to collect its mesh stats,
then restarts the OpenCascade runtime between kits to bound native geometry
state during a full-catalog build. The integration suite rebuilds the index in
memory and checks source hashes, mesh budgets, one-material output, and the
Studio parameter list. Treat the committed total as verified only after that
suite passes.

Use the stale-index check during review without changing generated output:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/buildAssetCatalog.ts --check
```

The local static page builder is a separate check from deployed website
behavior. Do not infer deployment or physical acceptance from local catalog
builds.

## Alpine expedition assets

The [alpine expedition kit](../catalog/kits/alpine-expedition/README.md) adds
50 original low-poly scene props for shelters, climbing, snow travel, rescue,
and field equipment. Each source exposes overall scale and asset color, and
the catalog index carries the generated preview path. The [wave demo and
verification bundle](../artifacts/catalog-demos/alpine-expedition-wave-20261103/README.md)
shows the source-to-preview workflow and its local evidence; it does not claim
that this branch has been deployed.
